http://www.policyalmanac.org/games/aStarTutorial.htm

First you divide the grid into squares and areas.
Give the squares a state ( on , off , inaccessible... )

Until the endGoal is found : 

	Calculate the distance from the target
	advance to the closest value 
	
	
TODO :

Convert to more of an addon structure
	Calculate Distance ( MapTile start , MapTile end )
Calculate Diagonal distance as well
Use real distance ? Manhattan distance must be faster
